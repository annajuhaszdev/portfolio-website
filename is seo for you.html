        <p>As someone who stepped on the path of SEO about 2 years ago, I can definitely testify: I had limited knowledge of it. I even included it in my test assignment for my last job: </p>
        <p><i>“I have heard about SEO because I was looking into Etsy and I read that it is important. It incorporates image optimization, using the right tags and writing product description.”</i></p>
        <p>Well, I think I kind of had a grasp of it. These really are important parts of SEO, but boy oh boy I had (and still have) a lot to learn. So here is a perspective of someone who a couple of years ago used to mix up CEO with SEO.</p>
        <h2>What is SEO, and Why Do You Need It?</h2>
        <p>It stands for Search Engine Optimization and is ‌ about optimizing your website and online content according to ever-changing rules so that the search engine result pages (SERPs) end up “favoring” yours over your competitors. It appears for more consumers, which means higher organic traffic, so there is a higher chance of conversion, aka transaction. Sounds nice, doesn’t it?
        It is, but achieving measurable goals also takes time. I am not speaking about a matter of weeks, but from around 6 months to years. So why should you do it, when you could just pay for ads and achieve the same goals in much less time?
        It’s simple: It is a necessity. Anyone who tries to make it online can testify that it is a must. The optimization is not only about the traffic that it brings in, but it also stands for a certain quality standard, especially when it comes to content.</p>
        <p><b>Apart from the obvious reasons that include your income, you should aim to provide value.</b></p>
        <p>So the next question is: Am I gonna do this on my own, or should I pay someone to do it for me?</p>
        <h3>The most important factor to consider is your motive:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you want to obtain a career at an SEO agency or work as a freelancer for clients? You gotta have a good SEO.</li>
            <li>Do you want to build your own business? Are you engaging in a hobby that involves website creation? Maybe your portfolio? You still gotta have a good SEO.</li>
            <li>Are you writing on a social publishing platform, like Medium? You still gotta have a good SEO.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>So let’s try to determine if it’s for you or not!</b></p>
        <br>
        <h2>There Is No Ideal Personality Type</h2>
        <p>SEO has multiple building blocks. Technical SEO, On-page SEO (Content), Off-page (Links), which I will talk about in some of my next articles.</p>
        <p>The main point is that while having expert knowledge in all types can be advantageous, you can choose to focus on the one that resonates the most with you, especially when you are just starting out.</p>
        <h2>Which personality description fits you the most?</h2>
        <h3>The data slayer</h3>
        <p>The data slayer is the analytical mind of SEO. <b>If you enjoy crunching numbers, analyzing statistics, and diving deep into data to uncover trends and patterns, then technical SEO might be your perfect match.</b></p>
        <p>Technical SEO involves optimizing a website’s structure, performance, and backend elements to improve its search engine rankings. It requires a keen eye for detail and a logical approach to problem-solving.</p>
        <h3>The creative</h3>
        <p>On the other hand, if you find yourself constantly filled with creative ideas and have a knack for storytelling, the creative side of SEO may be your forte.</p>
        <p>Content SEO is all about crafting engaging and valuable content that not only ranks well on search engines but also resonates with your target audience.</p>
        <p><b>Writing captivating product descriptions, blog posts, and creating interesting multimedia content are all part of content SEO.</b></p>
        <p>This role demands creativity and the ability to adapt your writing style to different niches and audiences.</p>
        <h3>The Inbetween</h3>
        <p>For those who fall somewhere in between, there’s the creative individual who appreciates structure and routine occasionally.</p>
        <p>This SEO personality type can thrive in various areas of SEO. They might enjoy the creativity of content creation but also find satisfaction in optimizing on-page elements or building backlinks, which require a bit of routine and organization.</p>
        <p>In such cases, you can choose to explore different aspects of SEO and gradually specialize in the area that suits you best.</p>
        <h2>Let’s Wrap It Up</h2>
        <p>The field of SEO offers opportunities for individuals with diverse personality types and preferences. It’s not about fitting into a specific mold but finding the aspect of SEO that resonates with you the most. <b>Whether you’re the data slayer, the creative, or a blend of both, SEO allows you to develop and grow your skills in a field that is essential for anyone with an online presence.</b></p>
        <p>Whether you’re looking to enhance your website’s visibility or embark on a rewarding career, SEO can be a valuable tool that opens doors to success in the online world.</p>
