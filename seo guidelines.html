        <p>I previously mentioned my past in SEO multiple times in some of my other articles. I was drawn to the job because it required writing skills, the rest of the knowledge came with having to solve problems on the job. And with the help of my colleagues, of course. One thing that I’ve learned is how to create an SEO-friendly article following some crucial rules, so Google would favor them. I have proofread and created briefs for more than I have written, but it all comes down to a few simple rules. As I’ve delved into different platforms such as Medium, I’ve noticed that following these rules to a tee, although initially it seemed logical to me, can disrupt the originality of one’s work.</p>
        <h2>Rules of SEO Proofreading</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Length of the article:</b> 750–1000 words for guest posts, and 1000–1500 for blog posts.</li>
            <li><b>Usage of keywords (number, placement):</b> The content plan is based on a thorough competitor analysis and keyword research. This determines the topics and headlines. Each article brief is based on this knowledge. It is supposed to be detailed properly before being given to the copywriter. The key is integrating keywords naturally (around 1–2% of content) into titles, intros, headings, body, and conclusions — avoiding keyword stuffing.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p> <b>According to Google webmaster guidelines:</b></p>
        <p><i>“Keyword stuffing refers to the practice of filling a webpage with keywords or numbers in an attempt to manipulate rankings in Google Search results. Often these keywords appear in a list or group, unnaturally, or out of context.”</i></p>
        <p>As of now, keyword density is no longer an important ranking factor.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Linking structure and Anchor Text:</b> The content strategy is usually following a silo system, which means that there are main and subcategories, each having its link, that has to be placed in the article. The number shouldn’t be more than 3–5 times overall, and the anchor text is the keyword you link the site on. It is also recommended to link to another, dependable source, to show that your piece is not mere self-promotion (even when it kind of is). It helps showcase that you are aiming to provide value.</li>
            <li><b>Imagery and meta text :</b> The main image has to reflect the core of your text and has to be good quality, and (I’m not sure it is a requirement for copywriters everywhere), has to have a meta-text, explaining what’s going on in the image.</li>
            <li><b>Meta description :</b> A meta description is an approximately 140- character-long description of your article, which should also contain the keyword.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These were the rules I was checking when proofreading a piece from an SEO perspective. I also want to add that it’s not supposed to contain any personal opinions, as mostly, it is written to advertise a product or service, even if it aims to provide useful information.</p>
        <p>Suppose you’re tasked with writing an SEO article about a new skincare product. While injecting personal experiences might seem appealing, the primary goal is to highlight the product’s benefits, ingredients, and effectiveness. In this context, relying solely on personal opinions might deviate from the objective of convincing readers of the product’s value. However, weaving in a unique perspective or anecdote that aligns with the product’s benefits can provide a fresh angle without compromising the article’s credibility.</p>
        <h2>Why You Don’t Need All of Them</h2>
        <p>It can become redundant, especially when you stick to one topic. Most topics have been written about a million times. It’s close to impossible to come up with anything new. What makes a piece unique is the author’s personal opinions and experiences.</p>
        <p>While certain rules, such as the meta description, the rules regarding the imagery, the meta text belonging to it, and the importance of the title (with the keyword in it), can be crucial, it may not always be possible to execute the amount and placement of keywords naturally.</p>
        <p>For instance, having to incorporate a certain amount of keywords into a piece can come naturally, but can also be painfully difficult. While the keyword itself is essential, abusing it can disrupt the flow. Sometimes, what’s good for Google is not pleasant for the human eye.</p>
        <h2>The Things That Do Work</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Meta Descriptions:</b> A concise, keyword-inclusive meta description is crucial for attracting clicks and summarizing the article’s content.</li>
            <li><b>Imagery and Meta Text:</b> Utilizing high-quality images that align with the article’s theme and including descriptive meta text for these images can enhance the overall SEO of the content.</li>
            <li><b>Title Importance:</b> Titles containing the primary keyword play a significant role in SEO and attracting readers’ attention.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Keyword Usage:</b> While incorporating keywords is essential, doing so naturally and without compromising readability is crucial. Balancing keyword density with readability is a key aspect.</li>
            <li><b>Linking Structure:</b> Implementing a well-organized linking strategy, both internally and externally, contributes to SEO performance.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In the world of writing, it’s all about finding that sweet spot between rules and personality. Knowing your audience and goals helps you pick and choose which rules to follow, making your content stand out. Just like in life, good writing is a blend of playing by the rules while keeping it real. Strike that balance, and you’re on your way to quality content that clicks.</p>
